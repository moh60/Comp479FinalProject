Mission
 
The CSU campaigns department has a mandate to work explicitly around issues pertaining to social, environmental and economic justice. Our mandate is to:
 
provide support to groups working on campaigns in line with the CSU positions book ;
coordinate and implement the CSU’s annual campaign and, as needed, other campaigns;
implement the CSU positions book by informing and mobilizing the student body about the CSU’s positions on an ongoing basis.
 
Some of the projects and campaigns we have worked on and supported in the recent past include divestment from the fossil fuel industry; campaign to stop tuition hikes against international students; anti-consumerism week; anti-austerity organizing in Quebec and more.
 
If you are working on a campaign or project that is aligned with the CSU positions book, we may be able to help you with promotion, fundraising, and/or campaign planning and support; simply contact us with a description of your project and what type of support you are requesting and we will do our best to respond swiftly.
