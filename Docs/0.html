<body>Student Groups & Associations
The Concordia Student Union (CSU) represents and serves Concordia undergraduate students.
It shares this responsibility with the faculty associations, which represent students according to Concordia’s four faculties:
- Fine Arts Students Alliance (FASA)
- Arts & Science Federation of Associations (ASFA)
- Commerce and Administration Students’ Association (CASA)
- Engineering and Computer Science Association (ECA)
The Faculty Associations are not formally affiliated with the CSU, but are its equals and partners in representing and serving Concordia’s undergraduate students.
