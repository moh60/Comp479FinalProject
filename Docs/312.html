Concordia Part-Time Faculty Contemplates Strike Mandate
The Link – By  Riley Sparks — Published October 30, 2012
Determined to avoid a repeat of their last round of contract negotiations, which ended after seven years of deadlocked discussions, Concordia’s part-time faculty union will vote this Sunday on whether to adopt an unlimited strike mandate.
“We really haven’t made too much progress at the table, which is unfortunate,” said David Douglas, chair of communications and a member of the bargaining team for the Concordia University Part-Time Faculty Association.
CUPFA’s collective agreement, which was signed after the union began rotating strikes in their sixth year of negotiations, expired at the end of August.
