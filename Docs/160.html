Concordia is a dynamic university made up of small communities. With welcoming residences, accessible faculty, quality student services, we deliver a great education and a life-changing experience. 
How long will it take before students receive an admission decision?
Applicants will receive a response anywhere from 48 hours for Cegep students to eight weeks or more for international students. Because the admissions process varies for each student and program, we cannot give specific dates for a decision. See more details about the  application assessment period . The best thing for your student to do is to keep checking back at  MyConcordia.ca  for an update on the status of their application.
How big are the classes?
Concordia University strives to keep class sizes small and manageable, allowing students to create lasting relationships with their professors, as well as get the full advantages offered to them by having direct access to their instructors. Approximately two thirds of our first-year undergraduate courses have fewer than 60 students.
What should students do if they are having trouble in a course?
At Concordia, there are many resources available to assist students if they are having trouble with their academics. Professors and teaching assistants have office hours, and academic advising is available through each individual  Faculty .
We also offer a variety of academic services, such as tutoring, mentoring and skills workshops and personal support through our Student Success Centre .
How safe are university campuses?
The  Concordia University Security Department  is dedicated to maintaining a secure university environment which allows students to study, work and live in a safe setting. Our school maintains 24-hour campus patrol, and all of our residences are equipped with both an access card and key system in order to maximize safety.
Furthermore, students can opt to receive emergency alerts from the university via email or text message on their cell phone. They can sign up for this service through their  MyConcordia portal , under the “Messaging” tab.
There are two campuses? How do students get from Sir George Williams to Loyola in time for class?
Students, faculty, and staff with a valid Concordia ID card can take advantage of a free, 20-minute  shuttle bus service  between campuses. Our shuttle buses run on a regular  schedule , approximately every 20 to 25 minutes.
Or, for avid cyclists, the city’s De Maisonneuve bike path connects our two campuses for an easy ride.
What public transportation options are available in Montreal?
The  Société de transport de Montréal  (STM) maintains an extensive network of bus routes and underground metro stations throughout the city that is reliable and easy to use. In addition, the STM offers a reduced-fare monthly bus/metro pass (the OPUS card) for students.
