Concordia International student mobility programs
Options for Concordia students
Concordia Student Exchange Program (CSEP)
This program allows Arts & Science students to study abroad for a semester or two at one of Concordia's partner universities. These universities have exchange agreements with Concordia, which allows students to study abroad while continuing to pay Concordia tuition.

Arts & Science students interested in studying at an institution that does not have an exchange agreement with Concordia may still be granted permission to do so. In this situation, students would be required to pay tuition directly to their host university.
