Equality
Only 17% of students who enroll in engineering programs across Canada are women, and only 7% of registered professional engineers are women. Our goal is to address the under-representation of women in the engineering field.
Outreach
Through our outreach division, WIE initiates programs both within and outside the university community, which serve to promote engineering and computer science to women of all ages and races.
Engineering
WIE supports female engineering and computer science students at Concordia University and strives to help them gain academic and financial support, while encouraging their involvement in various competitive teams and social events.
About us
Women in Engineering aims to provide female engineering and computer science students with academic, social, and professional support along their educational path at Concordia University.
