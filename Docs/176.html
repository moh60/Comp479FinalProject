<title>Summer schools</title>
<body>Cultivating innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to research, teaching and learning
 
  
This summer, the Faculty of Arts and Science hosted four intensive, interdisciplinary  summer schools and two field schools that brought together Masters and PhD students from various  disciplines, and from around the world.
 
Led by Concordia professors in collaboration with international guest lecturers, selected students immersed themselves in a challenging and vibrant intellectual environment.
This unique opportunity allowed academic fields to converge while addressing complex themes.
