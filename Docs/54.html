Types of Funding
Project Application
The Project Applications to the CSU Community Action Fund are subject to a maximum of $3,000. The Community Action Fund has a mandate to fund community projects which have scarce access to funding. As such, if you apply on behalf of a student club or association, or for a project which is part of your program of study, you must prioritize other funding channels and the Community Action Fund will not review your application before you have shown that you have exhausted other sources of funding.

Operational Grant Application
The Operational Grant Applications to the CSU Community Action Fund are subject to a maximum of $2,500. The Community Action Fund has a mandate to fund community organizations which have scarce access to funding. As such, Operational Grant Applications from student clubs or associations, or from any organization funded through a fee-levy will not be considered.
Operational Grant Application Form
Strike Application
In the event that a Concordia undergraduate student association adopts a binding strike mandate, they can apply for funding under the Strike Application. Please note that according to the CSU Standing Regulations, the CSU Community Action Fund Committee must meet within 5 business days of the reception of the application. The Strike Applications to the CSU Community Action Fund are subject to a maximum of $1,000.
In the event that a student association which does not represent Concordia undergraduate students or any other organization wishes to apply for a grant to fund a strike, they may also apply under the Strike Application or the Project Application form. However, the 5 day deadline does not apply and the application will be reviewed according to the same timeline as other regular applications, unless otherwise decided by the Community Action Fund Committee.
