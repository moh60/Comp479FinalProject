<body>June Riley
Treasurer
I am June Riley, Treasurer of CUPFA since 2011. I have been part of the CUPFA Negotiations Team since 2014 helping to settle our 2012-2015 and 2015-2017 Collective Agreements. My duties as Treasurer include care and custody of Association funds and securities, including co-management of our strike fund – worth just over $2 million – along with our professional management team at Raymond James. I supervise the financial affairs of the Association including preparation of financial reports and budgets. I act as liaison between our accountant and auditor, ensure our monthly income statements are prepared, oversee staff payroll and insurance provisions for the executive. I ensure funds stemming from the Collective Agreement, including dues, fines and grievance awards, have been paid. I provide information to the membership about the CUPFA Endowment Scholarship and assist the President with CUPFA contingency funds. I also provide information to the membership about the Pension Plan for Employees of Concordia University and any updates on government retirement plans such as QPP and OAS. I maintain and update the financial protocols of the Association and co-chair the Finance Committee of the CUPFA Executive along with President Soroka.
I have been teaching at Concordia since 1988 in the Departments of Finance and Economics, where I have been the CUPFA hiring representative since 1998 and 2007 respectively. Over the years, I have served on other committees related to curriculum, student course evaluations, student retention and teaching and learning issues. Prior to that I worked as Financial Economist and then as Senior Economist in the investment banking industry, which gives me an applied knowledge about finances and accounting.
