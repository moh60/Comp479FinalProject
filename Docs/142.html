Montreal’s first female mayor — a new chapter in our city’s rich history
Harold Chorney, professor in the Department of Political Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science, writes in The Conversation Canada about the election of Valérie Plante to the mayor's office. He reflects on the groundbreaking nature of the Plante victory: a relative unknown who defeated a career politician to become Montreal's first female mayor. He looks also at the major challenge facing Plante from Day One: the city's crumbling infrastructure and Plante's campaign promises to make things right on our traffic-jammed roads, notably by making public transit a solid and welcoming alternative to the car.
