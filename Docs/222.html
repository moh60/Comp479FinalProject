<title>Collective Agreement for 2012 - 2015 Archives - Concordia University Faculty Association</title>
<body>GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING APPOINTMENTS
The principal criteria for appointments are academic and professional excellence.
Canadian applicants for a position as professional librarian shall be given first consideration and, in the case of candidates assessed as essentially equal, shall be given priority.
The Parties agree that Concordia University would better advance the essential functions of the University, namely the pursuit, creation and dissemination of knowledge through teaching and research, if the diverse composition of Canadian society were better reflected in the bargaining unit. Therefore the Parties agree to encourage an increase in the proportion of members of under-represented designated groups as defined in the relevant legislation, to improve their employment status, and to ensure their full participation in the University community. The Parties therefore endorse the principle of equity in employment and agree to cooperate in the identification and removal of all barriers to the recruitment, selection, hiring, retention, and promotion of these designated groups, and other categories as may be designated in federal and provincial human rights legislation or agreed to by the Parties.
To be appointed as a professional librarian an individual shall have an appropriate bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree from an ALA-accredited library and information science program, or approved equivalent training acceptable for membership in the Corporation of Professional Librarians of Québec.
The Employer shall provide a process through which members may voluntarily identify themselves as belonging to one or more designated groups. Information pertaining to members submitted to government agencies under relevant legislation on employment equity shall be made available to JEEC and to the Association on an aggregate basis within thirty (30) days of submission.
If the data on professional librarian availability indicates that a particular designated group is under represented, then, all things being equal, candidates from that designated group shall be given priority.

REAPPOINTMENT, PROMOTION, EVALUATION AND REVIEW OF REGULAR MEMBERS
GENERAL CRITERIA
This article sets out general criteria for application on a University-wide basis. In addition, each Dean, after appropriate consultation, may adapt these criteria in a manner appropriate and reasonable to the particular academic area. In particular, each Dean, after consultation, shall specify whether supervision of student research is to be considered as teaching or research. In all such cases the Dean shall inform all faculty members in writing within a reasonable period of time, before such specification takes effect.
The evaluation of full-time faculty shall be based upon the consideration of professional competence and potential for fulfilling academic responsibilities as defined in Article 16.
The evaluation of teaching shall be done by the faculty member’s colleagues on the basis of all evidence of teaching effectiveness presented by the faculty member in a teaching dossier.
The teaching dossier shall include the following:
a list of undergraduate and graduate courses, including directed studies taught by the member and, if specified by the Dean as teaching under the provisions of Article 14.01 a), thesis and other student research supervisions undertaken by the member;
examples of course outlines, assignments, final examinations or other materials the member deems appropriate;
all aggregate statistical information generated from teaching evaluation questionnaires specified in Article 14.01 f) for each course taught during the period under evaluation.
The teaching dossier may also include, but is not restricted to, the following:
a record of the member’s role in curriculum innovation and instructional development such as administrative and committee service for the academic unit, Faculty, or Senate related to pedagogy, and including directing and coordinating programs, guest lectures, and other presentations;
a record of the member’s special contribution to teaching including teaching awards, publications and presentations, instructional development grants, participation in conferences and seminars on education/pedagogy, and other such evidence as the member deems appropriate;
signed letters and testimonials from students;
a statement of the member’s objectives and methods of teaching, including reference to institutional and academic unit teaching goals.
A teaching evaluation questionnaire approved by the relevant Faculty Council shall be administered in all courses. The Provost and the President of CUFA shall agree on four questions common to all student evaluation questionnaires.
Before the adoption of on-line course evaluations in a Faculty, the Dean shall consult Faculty Council.
The Employer shall endeavour to ensure that anonymity and confidentiality are maintained in the administration of course evaluations.
The evaluation of research shall depend primarily on the judgment of the faculty member’s disciplinary peers, and shall be made on the basis of evidence of scholarship such as publications, presentations of papers, exhibitions, performances, patents, copyrights, external recognition, grants, contracts and other awards and, if appropriate (see Article 14.01 a)), thesis and other student research supervision undertaken by the member, as presented by the faculty member in a research dossier. In this evaluation, more weight shall be given to peer-reviewed than to non-peer-reviewed work, to the extent appropriate to the discipline.
The evaluation of service to the University and the community, including participation in University governance and academic administration, service to the Association and the professional and academic community, shall depend primarily on the judgment of the faculty member’s colleagues, and shall take into account evidence of such activities as presented by the faculty member in a service dossier.
The complete dossier consists of a current curriculum vitae and all three component parts: the teaching dossier (Article 14.01 c), d) and e) and f)), the research dossier (Article 14.01 i)), and the service dossier (Article 14.01 j)), with the proviso that ETA members shall not be required to submit a research dossier. Preparation of a digital version of the dossier is the responsibility of the Employer, unless the member chooses to prepare it in accordance with prescribed guidelines. When the Employer prepares the digital dossier, the member shall ensure that she or he is satisfied with its contents.
The academic unit head shall ensure that the dossier contains:
In the case of probationary members, reports produced in the course of the most recent reappointment exercise;
In the case of tenured and ETA members with a five (5) year contract, reports produced in the course of the most recent performance evaluation.
In the context of this clause, “reports” shall mean reasoned reports, recommendations and decisions issued by the DPC, FPTC, Dean, and Provost, as applicable.
The academic unit head and the Dean may supplement the dossier submitted by the candidate with relevant information at the start of the DPC stage of the proceedings. In this instance, the candidate shall be informed of the nature of this information, shall receive copies of all supplemental documentation and shall have five (5) days to provide any commentary relevant to this supplementary information. If the candidate subsequently sends additional information to the FPTC, a copy shall be sent to the DPC.
The evaluation of members holding a joint or cross appointment shall be conducted by the primary unit, which shall seek input from the secondary unit or units.
EVALUATION OF PROBATIONARY AND NOMINALLY TENURED FACULTY MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REAPPOINTMENT
Reappointments for probationary members shall be for a period of two (2) years terminating on May 31. In the case of probationary members the contract shall not extend more than one year beyond the year of mandatory tenure consideration.

Reappointments for nominally tenured faculty members shall be for a period of one (1) year terminating on May 31.
A member who has been on a leave in accordance with Article 33 or 35 for at least six (6) consecutive months during the period being evaluated shall have the option of being considered for reappointment the following year. Should the member exercise this option, the probationary appointment shall be extended for one year.
A member who, at the application deadline, is on a leave in accordance with Article 33 or 35 of not less than forty-five (45) days shall have the option of being considered for reappointment the following year.
The evaluation shall pay particular attention to the quality of the candidate’s teaching, research activities, and publications as well as potential. In addition, the candidate’s participation in the life of the University and the Community as specified in 16.01 c) shall be considered.
A faculty member who is a candidate for evaluation for reappointment is expected to have fulfilled any special conditions in the previous contract.
In the case of probationary appointments specifically indicated as having been made in a new program, the continuation of the position itself may be a criterion for renewal only within five (5) years of the year in which students were first enrolled in the program. The faculty member shall be so informed prior to appointment.
In the case of a reappointment of a nominally tenured member, she or he is expected to address the status of his or her application for Permanent Residency only.
PROMOTION OF PROBATIONARY FACULTY MEMBERS FROM LECTURER TO ASSISTANT PROFESSOR
A probationary faculty member appointed at the rank of Lecturer shall be automatically promoted to the rank of Assistant Professor following completion of all requirements for the terminal degree and placed on the salary grid in accordance with the following provisions:
The date of promotion from Lecturer to Assistant Professor shall be retroactive to the start date of the contract provided that the date of completion of all requirements of the terminal degree occurs within six (6) months of that date; otherwise, the promotion shall occur on the date of completion of all requirements of the terminal degree.
Promotion shall be granted on the basis of a letter from the university that awarded the terminal degree formally attesting to the date of completion of all requirements.
PROMOTION FROM ASSISTANT PROFESSOR TO ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR
Upon the granting of tenure, faculty members who hold the rank of Assistant Professor shall be promoted to the rank of Associate Professor.
PROMOTION FROM ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR TO PROFESSOR
The following criteria for promotion to the rank of Professor, while laying down the broad qualifications for the rank, are at the same time intended to provide sufficient flexibility to enable each academic unit to apply the standards it considers relevant to its field. While the career paths of individuals will vary, it is expected that the majority of tenured faculty members will meet the qualifications for this rank, albeit at different points, in their careers.
The rank of Professor may be attained by fulfilling any one of the following sets of criteria:
Research/scholarly achievement/creative professional work that is demonstrably superior over a sustained period of time, together with university teaching that has been demonstrated over the years to be of good quality.
The candidate shall submit a research dossier to demonstrate that she or he has made a substantial contribution to her or his field through research, scholarly achievement or creative professional work. While the greatest weight will be given to research/scholarly achievement or creative/professional work, the candidate shall also submit a teaching dossier to demonstrate that her or his teaching has been of good quality.
In this category, a faculty member may be considered following completion of six (6) years of service at the rank of Associate Professor.
In exceptional cases, a member may be considered for promotion before the completion of six (6) years of service, with the proviso that promotion shall be granted only on the basis of a record of achievement consistent with that normally required for promotion.
Teaching that is demonstrably superior over a sustained period of time together with scholarship/creative professional work which has been demonstrated over the years to be of good quality.
The candidate shall submit a teaching dossier to demonstrate that she or he has made a substantial contribution to higher education through teaching and other pedagogical activities. While the greatest weight will be given to the quality of teaching, the candidate shall also submit a research dossier to demonstrate that her or his scholarly activity or creative professional work has been of good quality.
In this category, a faculty member may be considered for promotion following completion of six (6) years of service at the rank of Associate Professor.
A combination of teaching; scholarship/creative professional work; and service to the academic and professional community that has been demonstrated over the individual’s career to be of good quality.
The candidate shall demonstrate, by means of the complete dossier, that she or he has maintained a career profile that combines dedicated teaching, an ongoing engagement in scholarly work and service contributions to the University and the professional and academic community. It is understood that the greatest weight will be given to the candidate’s aggregate contributions to the University over a sustained period of time, rather than to any one of the three areas of responsibility. It is also understood that teaching, research, and service might evolve and assume different proportions at various periods in a member’s academic life.
In this category a faculty member may be considered for promotion following the completion of nineteen (19) years in the combined ranks of Assistant and Associate Professor.
NOTE: The provisions of Article 14.05 e) shall apply until May 31, 2014, at which time they shall become null and void. All applications under the provisions of this Article must be received prior to October 1, 2013.
A faculty member may apply for promotion or may be nominated with her or his consent. If the candidate had not requested the promotion, a refusal shall not appear in the candidate’s personnel file. It is the responsibility of the members to prepare the requisite dossier even when they are nominated for promotion.

the quality of teaching of candidates applying for promotion under the provisions of Article 14.05 c) shall be assessed by the DPC based upon the teaching dossier presented by the candidate. In some cases, the DPC may wish to solicit evaluations from other individuals within the University who can attest to the candidate’s teaching effectiveness. Any such evaluators shall be chosen in consultation with the candidate.
evaluations of the teaching quality of candidates applying for promotion under the provisions of Article 14.05 d) shall be solicited from experts in the candidate’s discipline both at other universities or institutions and at Concordia who can attest to the candidate’s effectiveness as a teacher and her or his contribution to pedagogy in the discipline.

EVALUATION OF ETA FACULTY MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REAPPOINTMENT
ETA Members are eligible for reappointment subject to the availability of work and a positive evaluation of their performance.
The first reappointment shall be for approximately thirty-six (36) consecutive months with the exception that in the case of a candidate who had served as an LTA for at least thirty-three (33) months of the five (5) years preceding her or his initial appointment, the first reappointment shall be for sixty (60) consecutive months. All subsequent reappointments shall be for approximately sixty (60) consecutive months.
For the purposes of this clause, “availability of work” shall mean that the number of probationary and tenured members is insufficient to cover the academic unit’s or Faculty’s teaching and service commitments for which the member is qualified based on concrete information at the time of the reappointment. In the case where there is insufficient work for all ETAs in an academic unit or Faculty, any remaining ETA positions shall be allocated based on performance and relevant qualifications.

The academic unit head shall provide a minimum of twenty (20) days’ notice of each meeting.
The member shall compile and bring to the meeting a record of her or his research, teaching and/or service activities of the past year, as applicable.
The member may be accompanied by a member of her or his choice.
Meetings will normally take place between May 1 and June 30 of each academic year.
Within ten (10) days following the meeting, the academic unit head shall provide to the faculty member a letter which shall reflect the discussion at the meeting and shall identify both those aspects of the member’s performance that meet or exceed the normal criteria, and any that fail to meet the criteria. In the case of aspects of performance that fail to meet the normal criteria, the letter shall recommend measures intended to improve the member’s performance.
A copy of the letter shall be provided to the Dean.
The letter shall not be included in the member’s dossier at the time of consideration for reappointment or tenure, except under the provisions of Article 21.07 c) iii).
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF TENURED MEMBERS AND ETA MEMBERS HOLDING FIVE-YEAR APPOINTMENTS
Performance of duties and responsibilities of continuing tenured members and ETA members holding five-year appointments shall be evaluated by the DPC and reviewed by the Dean with the FPTC.
This performance evaluation shall take place in the Fall of every even-numbered year. Criteria for awarding Career Development Increments (CDI)/step increases shall be governed by Article 14.01. Continuing members shall submit dossiers as stipulated in paragraph c) below, and shall be evaluated on their performance of duties (Article 16). Satisfactory performance evaluation leads to the awarding of CDI/step increases in accordance with Article 39.
On or before October 1 in even-numbered years, continuing members shall submit to the academic unit head a complete updated curriculum vitae, and a dossier, prepared according to the provisions of Article 14.01 k), covering only their activities over the previous two (2) academic years.

REAPPOINTMENT, PROMOTION AND EVALUATION OF PROBATIONARY AND TENURED LIBRARIANS
GENERAL CRITERIA
This article sets out general criteria for application on a University-wide basis. In addition, the Dean, after appropriate consultation, may adapt these criteria in a manner appropriate and reasonable to the particular library/academic area. In such a case the Dean shall inform all librarian members in writing a reasonable period of time before such changes take effect.
The evaluation of librarian members shall be
based upon consideration of professional competence and potential for fulfilling the duties and responsibilities as defined in Article 17.
done by the librarian member’s colleagues on the basis of evidence brought forward by the member and all additional material brought forward in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
The evaluation of professional contributions to the Library’s operation and development shall depend primarily on the judgment of the librarian member’s colleagues and shall be based upon evidence of such activities as presented by the librarian member in a “professional librarian activities dossier”. The dossier may include, but is not restricted to, such items as the following:
a list of professional librarian activities undertaken or completed by the librarian member, participation in or attendance at Library presentations and workshops, and other such evidence as the member deems appropriate.
examples reflective of the librarian member’s role in the Library as described in the job description, which may include participation in the preparation of policies, writing of procedures, and reports, assessments of instructional activities, statistics, outlines relating to library instruction and other documentation and material attesting to the member’s contribution to the operation and development of the Library that the member deems appropriate;

statement of the librarian member’s principles, objectives and methods of providing library services in light of the Library’s vision and mission;
signed testimonials from faculty and students;
The evaluation of research and scholarship shall depend primarily on the judgment of the librarian member’s peers and shall be made on the basis of evidence of scholarship, such as publications, presentation of papers, external recognition, grants, contracts and other awards, as presented by the librarian member in a research dossier. In this evaluation, more weight shall be given to peer-reviewed than to non-peer-reviewed work to the extent appropriate to the field.
The evaluation of service to the University and the community, including participation in University governance and academic administration, and service to the Association and the professional and academic community, shall depend primarily on the judgment of the librarian member’s colleagues, and shall take into account evidence of such activities as presented by the librarian member in a service dossier.
The complete dossier consists of a current curriculum vitae and all three component parts: the professional librarian activities dossier (Article 15.01 c)), the research and scholarship dossier (Article 15.01 d)) and the service to the University and the community dossier (Article 15.01 e)). Preparation of a digital version of the dossier is the responsibility of the Employer, unless the member chooses to prepare it in accordance with prescribed guidelines. When the Employer prepares the digital dossier, the member shall ensure that she or he is satisfied with its contents.
The Chair of the LPC, with the assistance of the Associate University Librarian, shall ensure that the dossier contains:
In the case of probationary members, reports produced in the course of the most recent reappointment exercise;
In the case of tenured members, reports produced in the course of the most recent performance evaluation.
In the context of this clause, “reports” shall mean reasoned reports, recommendations and decisions issued by the LPC, LPRC, LTC, Dean and Provost, as applicable.
The Associate University Librarian and the Dean may supplement the dossier submitted by the candidate with relevant information at the start of the LPC stage of the proceedings. In this instance, the candidate shall be informed of the nature of this information, shall receive copies of all supplemental documentation and shall have five (5) days to provide any commentary relevant to this supplementary information. If the candidate subsequently sends additional information to the LPRC, a copy shall be sent to the LPC.
EVALUATION OF PROBATIONARY AND NOMINALLY TENURED LIBRARIAN MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REAPPOINTMENT
Reappointments for probationary members shall be for a period of two (2) years terminating on May 31. Contracts shall not extend more than one year beyond the year of mandatory tenure consideration.

Reappointments for nominally tenured librarian members shall be for a period of one (1) year terminating on May 31.
A member who has been on a leave in accordance with Article 33 or 35 for at least six (6) consecutive months during the period being evaluated shall have the option of being considered for reappointment the following year. Should the member exercise this option, the probationary appointment shall be extended for one year.
A member who, at the application deadline, is on a leave in accordance with Article 33 or 35 of not less than forty-five (45) days shall have the option of being considered for reappointment the following year.
The evaluation shall pay particular attention to the quality of the candidate’s performance of professional librarian activities and research and scholarship under the provisions of Article 17.01 a) and b) as well as potential. In addition, the candidate’s participation in the life of the University and the community as specified under the provisions of Article 17.01 c) shall be considered.
A librarian member who is a candidate for evaluation for reappointment is expected to have fulfilled any special conditions in the previous contract.

PROMOTION FROM ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN TO ASSOCIATE LIBRARIAN
Upon the granting of tenure, librarian members who hold the rank of Assistant Librarian shall be promoted to the rank of Associate Librarian.
PROMOTION FROM ASSOCIATE LIBRARIAN TO SENIOR LIBRARIAN
The following criteria for promotion to Senior Librarian, while laying down the broad qualifications for the rank, are at the same time intended to provide sufficient flexibility to enable the Library to apply the standards it considers relevant to its field. While the career paths of individuals will vary, it is expected that the majority of tenured librarian members will meet the qualifications for this rank, albeit at different points, in their careers.
The rank of Senior Librarian may be attained by fulfilling any one of the following sets of criteria:
Research and scholarship that is demonstrably superior over a sustained period of time, together with professional librarian activities that have been demonstrated over the years to be of good quality.
The candidate shall submit a research and scholarship dossier to demonstrate that she or he has made a substantial contribution to librarianship through research, scholarly and critical or creative work. While the greatest weight will be given to research and scholarship, the candidate shall also submit a professional librarian activities dossier to demonstrate that her or his service to the operation and development of the Library as an academic service and resource has been of good quality.
In this category, a librarian member may be considered for promotion following the completion of six (6) years of service at the rank of Associate Librarian.
In exceptional cases, a member may be considered for promotion before the completion of six (6) years of service, with the proviso that promotion shall be granted only on the basis of a record of achievement consistent with that normally required for promotion.
Professional librarian activities that are demonstrably superior over a sustained period of time, together with research and scholarship which has been demonstrated over the years to be of good quality.
The candidate shall submit a professional librarian activities dossier to demonstrate that she or he has made a substantial contribution to the operation and development of the Library as an academic service and resource. While the greatest weight will be given to the quality of professional librarian activities, the candidate shall also submit a research and scholarship dossier to demonstrate that her or his research, scholarly and critical or creative work has been of good quality.
In this category, a librarian member may be considered for promotion following the completion of six (6) years of service at the rank of Associate Librarian.
A combination of professional librarian activities, research and scholarship and service to the University and the community that has been demonstrated over the individual’s career to be of good quality.
The candidate shall demonstrate, by means of the complete dossier, that she or he has maintained a career profile that combines dedicated professional librarian activities, an ongoing engagement in research and scholarship and service contributions to the University and the community. It is understood that the greatest weight will be given to the candidate’s aggregate contributions to the University over a sustained period of time, rather than to any one of the three areas of responsibility. It is also understood that professional librarian activities, research and scholarship, and service, may evolve and assume different proportions at various periods in a member’s academic life.
In this category, a librarian member may be considered for promotion following the completion of nineteen (19) years of service in the combined ranks of Assistant Librarian (formerly Librarian II) and Associate Librarian.
NOTE The provisions of Article 15.04 e) shall apply until May 31, 2014 at which time they shall become null and void. All applications under the provisions of this Article must be received prior to October 1, 2013.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FACULTY MEMBERS
The duties and responsibilities of faculty members fall into three (3) categories, regardless of where they are performed.
Teaching, which in general includes: the preparation, organization and presentation of course materials for credit courses and availability to students outside of class hours; curriculum development and preparation of course material for student use; the direction and evaluation of student progress in courses and practical work (including marking and timely submission of grades) and if so specified by the Dean, thesis and other student research supervision (see Article 14.01 a)).
Research and Scholarship, which in general includes: research, scholarly and critical or creative work within the faculty member’s field; the dissemination of such work through respected publications, presentation of scholarly papers, exhibitions and performances, and other appropriate means; if so specified by the Dean (see Article 14.01 a)), the supervision of student research and theses, and the seeking of external research funding as appropriate to the discipline and the member’s research profile. The primary objectives of such research shall be to increase knowledge and understanding and to further the faculty member’s teaching and scholarly competence.
Service to the University and the Community, which in general includes:
participation on University-wide bodies;
administrative work;
committee membership at the levels of the academic unit, Faculty and University, including student advising on academic matters;
the taking of an active part in scientific, cultural, educational, professional, governmental and social bodies, together with activities involving expertise or popularization which are relevant to and compatible with the professorial role;
service to the Association;
outside professional activities.
While the pattern of duties and responsibilities indicated in 16.01 varies among academic units and among individuals, these constitute the principal obligations of any faculty member holding a full time appointment.
In accordance with the established procedures of the academic unit, and by mutual agreement with the faculty member, the academic unit heads and the Dean(s), academic duties may be assigned and carried out in academic units other than the member’s primary unit. In the case of members holding a joint or cross appointment, or participating in an interdisciplinary teaching or research project with one or more members of another academic unit, academic duties in both primary and secondary units shall be considered part of the member’s duties for the purposes of all evaluations conducted under the provisions of Articles 14 and 18.
TEACHING LOAD AND TEACHING ASSIGNMENT
The teaching load for each member shall be determined in a fair and equitable manner by the Dean, who shall take into consideration the dossier submitted for the biennial performance evaluation, if applicable.
In years in which no performance review takes place, the Dean may request from some or all members of the Faculty a summary of teaching, research and service activities since the most recent performance review. Having assessed this material, the Dean may alter the teaching load in conformity with the provisions of Article 16.
A Faculty or academic unit may develop guidelines on course remissions, which may also be used in the determination of teaching load. These guidelines shall require the approval of the Dean and may encompass such matters as supervision of undergraduate and graduate students, research, publications, other creative work, laboratory development, management and administrative duties, and other service responsibilities.
The annual teaching assignment for each member shall be fair and equitable, taking into account the nature of the courses, and the member’s research profile and service responsibilities.
By April 1 the academic unit head shall make available in writing to each member of the academic unit information concerning the teaching assignments of all full time faculty members of the academic unit for the current academic year. The information provided shall include the following:
the member’s annual teaching load as determined by the Dean under the provisions of Article 16.04 a);
the course sections taught by each member for the current academic year;
a note giving the reason for all reductions from the normal teaching load as defined in Article 16.07 and 16.08 a);
a note stating the teaching, if any, owed by the member to the University and of the future remissions, if any, owed by the University to the member.
After consultation with the member, the academic unit head shall recommend to the Dean no later than April 1 a teaching assignment for each member of the unit for the following academic year, beginning with the summer term.
The Dean shall inform each member of the Faculty no later than April 20 of her or his teaching assignment for the following academic year, beginning with the summer term. A copy shall be sent to the Association, and the information for each academic unit shall be made available in writing to each member of the academic unit.
Any subsequent change to the teaching assignment shall require the faculty member’s consent. Such consent in no way constitutes a precedent and shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 16.04 h), if unforeseen teaching needs require it, the Dean may readjust the teaching assignment after consultation with the member. In doing so, the Dean shall take into account the impact of this readjustment on the other activities the faculty member intended to take on. The Dean shall give reasonable notice in writing to a faculty member whose teaching assignment is to be modified from the one established in Article 16.03 a) above. Courses added to the teaching assignment shall include only those that the member has taught in one or more of the previous three (3) academic years.
When the teaching program of an academic unit or a Faculty includes courses in each of the three (3) terms of the academic year, the faculty member’s teaching assignment is spread out over the fall and winter terms, unless there is a written agreement with the faculty member to the contrary. In the case of those academic units that offer programs in the Institute for Cooperative Education, a faculty member’s teaching assignment may be spread over any two (2) of three (3) terms, if the faculty member is participating in the programs, unless there is written agreement with the faculty member to the contrary.
Notwithstanding the above, and in the case of other special or extensive summer programs, a faculty member may, by mutual agreement, spread the teaching assignment over two (2) or three (3) terms, but no faculty member shall be required to teach during all three (3) terms except as specified in Article 16.12.
Provision may be made for the averaging of the teaching load over a two (2) year period. Other duties and responsibilities will be adjusted to reflect the averaging of teaching duties.
The distribution among the faculty members of an academic unit or Faculty of the specific courses assigned is carried out taking into account their particular qualifications, any special conditions of appointment, and other activities.
Teaching duties shall be assigned, in the first instance, to academic staff.
PROBATIONARY MEMBERS
A teaching load not exceeding four (4) courses is appropriate during a probationary appointment to enable the member to establish a research program and to prepare new courses.
TENURED MEMBERS
A teaching load not exceeding four (4) courses per academic year shall be assigned to a tenured faculty member where there is clear evidence of satisfactory productivity in research and scholarship during the most recent evaluation period, taking into account the extent of the member’s service.
A teaching load not exceeding five (5) courses per academic year shall be assigned to a tenured faculty member where there is evidence of minimal productivity in research and scholarship during the most recent evaluation period, taking into account the extent of the member’s service.
A teaching load not exceeding six (6) courses per academic year shall be assigned to a tenured faculty member where there is no clear evidence of productivity in research and scholarship during the most recent evaluation period, taking into account the extent of the member’s service.
In setting the teaching load, the Dean may:
increase the member’s teaching load if justified under the provisions of Article 16.08 a), b) and c), taking into account the extent of the member’s service;
reduce the member’s teaching load if justified under the provisions of Article 16.08 a), b) and c) in cases where the member combines the teaching assignment with assigned extensive administrative responsibilities (e.g., undergraduate or graduate program Director), or with heavy responsibilities to manage and administer her or his research project(s).
No tenured member shall be assigned more than twelve (12) courses over a two (2) year period, except as specified in Article 16.12 a) or, by mutual agreement, as per Article 16.04 i), provided the overload is offset by an equivalent reduction in the academic year immediately preceding or following the two year period.
ETA MEMBERS
The duties and responsibilities of ETA members shall be those specified in Article 16.01 a) and 16.01 c).
A teaching load not to exceed seven (7) courses per academic year shall be assigned to ETA members whose duties and responsibilities include normal service to the University. The Dean shall reduce the member’s teaching load if the member combines the teaching assignment with more extensive service. In considering a member’s service contribution, the Dean shall take into account not only specifically assigned administrative duties, such as program directorships, but also such activities as course coordination, committee work, coaching of students for academic competitions and recruitment activities.
The minimum teaching load for ETA members will normally be four (4) courses per academic year.
ETA members who, during an academic year, are assigned to teach five or more courses, each of which requires a distinct course preparation, shall receive a stipend of $1,500 for each of the fifth (5th), sixth (6th), or seventh (7th) distinct course preparation.
LTA MEMBERS
The parties consider that a teaching load of seven (7) courses in a given academic year is appropriate for a member holding a twelve (12) month LTA appointment whose duties and responsibilities include minimal service to the University. However, for a member holding a nine and a half (9.5) month LTA, a teaching load of six (6) courses is appropriate for the period of appointment.
At least one (1) of the courses may be assigned in the summer term provided that twenty-two (22) consecutive days are available for vacation as per Article 31.06.
Members holding LTA appointments of twelve months or more, shall not teach more than fourteen (14) courses over a two (2) year period except as provided in Article 16.12 a).
Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of distinct course preparations in an academic year.
Members on leave should be consulted and shall be informed about their course assignments for the following academic year at the same time as other faculty members.
Stipends for Teaching Additional Courses
A member who has fulfilled the duties and responsibilities set out in this Article may, upon agreement with the Dean, teach up to two (2) additional courses that have been scheduled and are available, for a teaching stipend of $6,703, which shall be modified as follows:
Effective May 1, 2013: $7,560
Effective May 1, 2014: $7,711
Exceptionally, a member may teach a third additional course but only if at least one of the courses is scheduled and taught in the summer term. Probationary members holding their first contract may not teach more than one (1) additional course per academic year.

Tenure shall be granted only to Canadian citizens or permanent residents. A member whose tenure is approved by the Board of Governors prior to obtaining Canadian citizenship or permanent resident status shall be granted nominal tenure status until citizenship or permanent residency is obtained.
Tenure shall not apply to administrative offices or to any other position outside the bargaining unit.¬ However, a faculty member with tenure shall not relinquish tenure upon receiving such an appointment.¬ When the administrative term of office of a faculty member with tenure is completed, or should that person resign prior to the end of the term of office, she or he shall revert to faculty status with uninterrupted tenure.
A tenured faculty member who transfers from one (1) academic unit to another within the University shall retain her or his tenured status.
A tenured faculty member on reduced-time appointment as per Article 25 shall retain status as a faculty member with uninterrupted tenure.

To be eligible for mandatory or early consideration for tenure a candidate may not have been on leave for any extended period during the residential teaching terms of the calendar year prior to consideration, except in the case of leave in accordance with Article 35.
Tenure Criteria
For tenure to be granted, candidates shall have demonstrated a level and quality of competence and promise in the areas of activity described in Article 16.01 a) and 16.01 b) consistent with the academic unit, Faculty and University expectations, including conditions prescribed at the time of initial appointment or in the course of a reappointment exercise conducted in accordance with Article 14.
Performance during the overall period of the probationary appointment shall be taken into account in applying the above criteria; when a candidate is considered under the provisions of Article 18.06 a) i), consideration shall be given to accomplishments prior to the probationary appointment.
In addition to satisfying the criteria in Article 18.02 a), a candidate for tenure shall have given evidence of ability and willingness to fulfill the service expectations of the academic unit, Faculty, and University.
Mandatory Consideration for Tenure
The following provisions shall apply in all cases with the exception of those where mandatory consideration for tenure has been deferred under the provisions of Article 18.05.

in the case of members having taught ten (10) or more courses while holding the research appointment, by up to two (2) years;
in the case of members having taught no fewer than five (5) and no more than nine (9) courses, by one (1) year.
Tenure on Appointment
Notwithstanding Article 18.01 e) and Article 18.01 i), tenure may be conferred at the time of initial appointment to the University only at the rank of Associate Professor or Professor, and then only after a positive recommendation of the DTC. The academic unit head shall convene a meeting of the DTC in order to consider a candidate for tenure on appointment.
An appointment at the rank of Associate Professor may be offered with or without tenure. An appointment at the rank of Professor shall be offered only with tenure.

Should the DTC agree to deferral, a reasoned recommendation shall be forwarded to the Dean by October 31. The Dean shall review the request for deferral and the reasoned report of the DTC and make a decision by November 10.
Should the Dean agree to deferral, the member’s tenure consideration shall be deferred. Should the Dean not agree to deferral, the matter shall be brought before the FPTC whose decision shall be final and binding.
Notwithstanding Article 18.05 a), a member who was on leave in accordance with Article 35 or on a leave of not less than forty-five (45) days granted in accordance with Article 33, may request a deferral of tenure consideration.

In addition to satisfying the criteria in Article 19.02 a), a candidate for tenure shall have given evidence of ability and willingness to fulfill the service expectations of the unit, Library/Faculty, and University.
Mandatory Consideration for Tenure
The following provisions shall apply in all cases with the exception of those where mandatory consideration for tenure has been deferred under the provisions of Article 19.05.
The projected academic year of mandatory consideration for tenure shall be inserted in all contracts at the time of initial appointment.
A librarian member shall be considered for tenure during the academic year following the completion of four (4) years of service in a probationary appointment at the rank of Assistant Librarian at Concordia University.
A librarian member appointed without tenure at the rank of Associate Librarian shall be considered for tenure in the academic year following completion of the following number of years of service in a probationary appointment:
two (2) years, in the case of members appointed primarily on the basis of prior tenured or probationary service at another institution;

Deferral of Mandatory Tenure Consideration
A member may request that consideration of tenure be deferred only once for a single period of one (1) or two (2) years for specific reasons, despite the fact that she or he has reached the stage defined in Article 19.03. In no case shall consideration for tenure be further delayed. The decision to grant or deny deferral shall be limited to a decision to grant or deny the deferral for the period requested by the member.
The librarian member seeking deferral of mandatory tenure consideration has the burden of establishing her or his case in a letter outlining the reasons for the deferral request with supporting documentation, sent to the Dean, with copies to the Associate University Librarian, the Provost and the Association by October 15, in the academic year in which consideration for tenure would otherwise be mandatory.
The decision of the LTC that there are not sufficient grounds for deferral shall be final and binding. Such a decision shall not constitute a refusal of tenure, and the provisions for mandatory consideration of tenure as per Article 19.03 shall apply.
Deferral may be granted only upon the favourable recommendation of the LTC, which shall submit a reasoned report to the Provost with a copy to the member by October 31.
The Provost shall review the request for deferral and the reasoned report of the LTC and make a decision by November 10. The decision of the Provost shall be final and binding.
Notwithstanding Article 19.05 a), a member who was on leave in accordance with Article 35 or on a leave of not less than forty-five (45) days granted in accordance with Article 33, may request a deferral of tenure consideration. This deferral shall be automatic and shall have a duration of at least one (1) year.
Mandatory tenure consideration shall occur at the tenure exercise following the end of the deferral.
The granting of a deferral shall not prejudice a candidate’s case for tenure in subsequent tenure consideration.
The contract of a member granted a deferral of tenure shall be extended by a duration equal to the length of the deferral.
Early Consideration for Tenure
Librarian members who satisfy either of the following criteria may be considered for tenure prior to the date of normal mandatory consideration.
two (2) or more years of service in a probationary or tenured position at another university before the date of their probationary appointment at Concordia University;
a record of superior performance during their probationary appointment sufficient to justify application by the member.
In such cases, tenure shall be granted only following a determination that the candidate’s dossier is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with expectations for mandatory consideration as set out in Article 19.03.
Such consideration shall occur only following completion of the following numbers of years of service in a probationary appointment:
two (2) years, in the case of a librarian member holding the rank of Assistant Librarian;
one (1) year, in the case of a librarian member holding the rank of Associate Librarian.
Early consideration for tenure requires that the member notify the LPC, in writing, by October 15 of this intention, with copies to the Dean, the Provost and the Association. The responsibilities of the member going forward are those entailed in the regular mandatory tenure consideration process, as stipulated beginning in Article 19.09.

A candidate denied tenure following consideration under the provisions of Article 19.03 shall be offered a one (1) year non-renewable terminal appointment which shall terminate May 31 of the academic year following the year of application for tenure.
A candidate denied tenure following consideration under the provisions of Article 19.03 shall not be reconsidered for tenure.

Compensation for academic unit heads shall be set at one of three different levels depending on the size of the unit at October 1 of the academic year preceding the start of the appointment or any subsequent reappointment:
Level 1 (up to ten (10) continuing members): a stipend of $6,000 per annum;
Level 2 (from eleven (11) to thirty (30) continuing members): a stipend of $8,000 per annum;
Level 3 (more than thirty (30) continuing members): a stipend of $10,000 per annum.
Effective June 1, 2013, compensation for academic unit heads shall be set at one of four (4) different levels depending on the size of the unit at October 1 of the academic year preceding the start of the appointment or any subsequent reappointment:
Level 1: for up to ten (10) continuing members, excluding members on long-term disability: a stipend of $7,000 per annum;

In addition, such members shall have their teaching assignments adjusted in recognition of the administrative load they bear during their term(s) as academic unit heads. Academic unit heads will normally teach at least six (6) credits per year.
The functions of an academic unit head are to provide academic leadership and professional excellence, to administer the programs and resources in such a way as to achieve the stated goals of the academic unit, and to manage personnel. As part of their responsibilities, two (2) representatives of the academic unit heads appointed by the Association shall provide advice to the University administration during the negotiation of Collective Agreements of other bargaining units whose members report directly to them.
Appointment of an Academic Unit Head
In order to maintain continuity and minimize disruption in the academic unit, every effort should be made to complete the appointment process at least three (3) months before the end of the incumbent’s term.
The Advisory Search Committee for Academic Unit Head (ASCAH) shall be established as stipulated in Article 11.01 and shall seek input from members of the academic unit. The members of the bargaining unit shall be informed of the names of candidates on the short-list, and time shall be allowed for input before a recommendation is made. The ASCAH will submit its recommendation accompanied by the procedure followed and justification of the selection to the Dean. If the Dean agrees with the recommendation, she or he shall forward the recommendation to the Provost.
In the event that the Provost does not accept the recommendation of the Dean, the Provost shall justify her or his decision in a reasoned report to the Dean with a copy to the ASCAH. The Provost shall consult with the Dean and the ASCAH before making an appointment.
In the event that the Dean does not accept the ASCAH’s recommendation, the Dean shall send the committee a written justification for the rejection. The ASCAH shall reconsider the candidates available and shall forward another recommendation to the Dean.
If the Dean disagrees with the new recommendation of the ASCAH, the Dean shall forward her or his recommendation and the recommendation of the ASCAH to the Provost. The Provost shall consult with the Dean and the ASCAH before making an appointment.
When a position as academic unit head suddenly becomes vacant, the Dean shall recommend the appointment of an acting unit head to the Provost. Such recommendation shall be made after consultation with the members of the academic unit and shall have a duration of no longer than one (1) year.
The Provost shall issue the letter of appointment with a copy to the Association.
The Dean will discuss with the successful candidate the goals and needs of the academic unit and the conditions of appointment such as stipend, teaching assignment, administrative assistance, research assistance, etc.
Duration of Appointment
The term of appointment will normally be three (3) academic years, but may be up to five (5) academic years if the ASCAH so recommends.
In the academic year following the completion of a member’s appointment as academic unit head, and in recognition of the administrative load borne by a member during her or his term(s) as academic unit head, the Dean shall take into account the need to facilitate her or his integration into a normal pattern of duties and responsibilities by relieving her or him of some teaching duties. For a member who has completed one term as academic unit head, the Dean shall determine the teaching duties to be the same as the last academic year before the member became academic unit head, (before any administrative remission) and then reduce this assignment for the first academic term by three (3) credits following the completion of the administrative appointment. For a member who has so served for two (2) or more terms, the six (6) credits reduction will be for the first full academic year.
Instead of the reduced workload in Article 20.13, after three (3) consecutive years as an academic unit head, a member who is granted a sabbatical leave may opt to take it at ninety-two and a half percent (92.5%) of salary. After six (6) consecutive years as an academic unit head, (or five (5) years after a five-year appointment), the member may opt to take a granted sabbatical leave at one hundred percent (100%) of salary.
SUPERVISORY LIBRARIANS
Supervisory librarians are librarian members with specified supervisory responsibilities.
Members who are appointed as supervisory librarians shall be paid, on a bi-weekly basis, a stipend of $6,000 or $7,000 per annum for the duration of the appointment depending on the size and complexity of the unit.
Effective June 1, 2013 members who are appointed as supervisory librarians shall be paid, on a bi-weekly basis, a stipend of $6,500 or $7,500 per annum for the duration of the appointment depending on the size and complexity of the unit.
The supervisory librarians shall have their library assignments adjusted in recognition of the administrative load they bear.
Appointment of a supervisory librarian
When a supervisory librarian position becomes available or is created, a Search Committee for Supervisory Librarians (SCSL) shall be established as stipulated in Article 11.13.
The principal criteria for the appointment of a supervisory librarian are academic leadership and professional excellence, combined with a demonstrated capacity for managing the programs and resources and achieving the stated goals of the Library.
The SCSL will seek input from librarian members. It will submit its recommendation accompanied by the procedure followed and justification of the selection to the Dean. The Dean shall forward the recommendation to the Vice-President, or, in the event that the Dean disagrees with the committee’s recommendation, the Dean shall provide the Vice-President with a written justification for the rejection, with a copy to the SCSL. The SCSL shall consider the candidates available and forward another recommendation to the Dean.
In the event that the Vice-President does not accept the recommendation of the Dean, the Vice-President shall justify her or his decision in a reasoned report to the Dean with a copy to the SCSL. The Vice-President shall consult with the Dean and the SCSL before making an appointment.
When the Dean and the SCSL cannot recommend a candidate after the reconsideration in Article 20.20 above, the Dean shall recommend the appointment of an acting head to the Vice-President. Such appointment shall have a duration of not more than one (1) year.
When a position of unit head becomes vacant suddenly, the Dean shall recommend the appointment of an acting head to the Vice-President. Such appointment shall have a duration of no longer than one (1) year.
The Vice-President shall issue the letter of appointment, with a copy to the Association.
Duration of Appointment
The term of appointment will normally be three (3) academic years, but may be up to five (5) academic years if the SCSL so recommends, and may subsequently be renewed.
The Dean will discuss with the successful candidate the goals and needs of the Division and the conditions of appointment such as stipend, administrative assistance, research assistance, etc.
A member who ceases to be a supervisory librarian shall continue to hold a librarian position with duties that take into account her or his qualifications, experience and expertise. Furthermore, the Dean, in recognition of the administrative load borne, shall take into account the need to facilitate reintegration through a reduction of duties and responsibilities for up to one (1) year.
Instead of the reduced workload in Article 20.27, after three (3) consecutive years as supervisory librarian, a member who is granted a sabbatical leave may opt to take it at ninety-two and a half percent (92.5%) of salary. After six (6) consecutive years as supervisory librarian, (five (5) years after a five-year appointment), the member may opt to take a granted sabbatical leave at one hundred percent (100%) of salary.
