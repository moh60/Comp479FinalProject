<body>DO help your peers share their achievements.
Don’t post photos or videos of yourself engaging in questionable activities. Don’t react emotionally during conversations and never resort to bullying, humiliation or threats. Don’t trash your teachers, organizations, potential employers or anyone else for that matter. Don’t lie, cheat or plagiarize. Don’t think your retweets or likes aren’t representing you. Don’t use expletives in rants about how much you hate something. Don’t rely on privacy settings entirely and never share sensitive personal information.
