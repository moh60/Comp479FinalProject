Not receiving the newsletter? We receive our undergraduate student list after the drop deadline of every academic term and update our mailing list accordingly. If you want to receive the newsletter at a different email address than that which you used to register at Concordia, then please contact us at commscoordinator@csu.qc.ca  After each semester our mailing list is updated once again, so if you want to avoid having to contact us to update your email every semester, then please update your primary email address via the myconcordia.ca portal.  You could also sign up your new email using the form below, but keep in mind that your registration will only be valid for the semester in questions as the content of our newsletters are intended for Concordia undergraduate students exclusively.
