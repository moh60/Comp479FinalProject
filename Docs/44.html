Hive Free Lunch
Food options are scarce at Loyola, and the CSU is doing what they can to make it better! That’s why we funding free vegetarian meals, served at 12:30 pm Monday to Friday at The Hive, that is open to all undergraduate students.

♡ People's Potato Collective
Concordia couldn’t be Concordia without the People’s Potato, an absolute pillar of the Concordia Community. Offering a delicious and healthy vegan meal every day, Monday to Friday from 12:30 to 2pm, for the entirety of the Fall and Winter semesters, the Potato serves as a hub of the downtown campus, serving more than 400 meals a day. They also provide other fundamental services to the community, such as food banks for students in need. It is difficult to overstate the importance of the People’s Potato to Concordia, and to the wider Montreal community. Drop by any day of the week for one of the best meals on campus, bring your own tupperware to get fed faster, and consider stopping in early or staying around after you eat to volunteer and help the Potato keep doing what it does: supporting our community with good food.
