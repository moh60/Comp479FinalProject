<body>Message from the Dean
Dear staff, students, and faculty members of the Faculty of Arts and Science,
There a sense of excitement in the air and so much going on for the Faculty in the 2017-18 academic year, as we build on our bold successes. 
We have a lot to be proud of — and a lot to look forward to.
Last year, we celebrated the public launch of FAS 2025 , a transformative 10-year plan for the Faculty, that reflects our creativity, passion and diversity. Our Beyond Disciplines public discussion series continued to break attendance records and demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary research firsthand. And — for the first time, but definitely not the last! — we participated in the NSERC-organized and country-wide Science Odyssey , which brought both our campuses alive with 10 days of exciting science-related activities.
This year we welcome our first-ever Jurist-in-residence, Judge Morton Minc. Having a jurist of Judge Minc’s stature join our faculty is a great honour, and students will have a wonderful opportunity to benefit from his many years of experience in law and social justice issues.
Beyond Disciplines returns for a third year, starting October 18. These public events explore major current questions and topics from a variety of viewpoints, across our sectors — sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. I encourage you to join us and see what everyone’s talking about – and to subscribe to the podcast !
Other exciting FAS projects for the 2017-18 academic year include the launch of Montreal 2050, a hub for research and action with the goal of creating a city at the leading edge of urban design and planning, and the continuation of our partnership with the Blue Metropolis literary festival.
To keep tabs on all inspirational initiatives, bookmark our news page , follow us on Twitter , and join our Facebook group . 
Lastly, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all students who are joining us for the first time. You are now part of a wonderful family. We are all here to support you as you begin your academic journey with us. 
It’s going to be a creative year!
My best to all of you for 2017-2018. 
André Roy,
