<body>Health and Dental Plan
 
As an undergraduate student registered for more than 3 credits and paying tuition fees at either the Canadian or Quebec rates, you are automatically covered by the CSU Health and Dental Plan.  The plan is a valuable service designed by your Student Union to fill the gap left by provincial health care.  The cost of the plan for a full-year’s coverage is $193.07 ($83.81 for Health, $109.26 for Dental)  and is included in your tuition bill.  If you are covered by another private insurance plan then you can opt out of this fee during the set change-of-coverage period. All enrolments must be completed during the appropriate Change-of-Coverage period.
