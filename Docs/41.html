Concordia Food Coalition
Concordia Food Coalition (CFC) is a group concerned about the economic, ecological, and social implications of the food system at Concordia University . At the CFC, we bring together students, faculty and staff to promote and facilitate a transition to a more sustainable food system in collaboration with organizations at Concordia and beyond . Our aim is to foster a community-centered food system that will begin at Concordia University, but that will be built with expansion in mind . Please contact us to get involved in the food movement happening at Concordia!
Address: 2090 Mackay Street (Suite Z-304)

Concordia Greenhouse
Located in a rooftop greenhouse at the top of the Hall building, downtown (take the stairs from the 12th floor!), the Greenhouse is a badly-needed oasis of sun, warmth, plants, and the intoxicating smell of life going about its business . It provides a gorgeous atrium for students to relax, work, and socialize, as well as multiple rooms housing projects ranging from a Tea Garden, to a full scale Aquaponics system . Their annual seedling sale is a mainstay of Montreal’s urban farmers, and goes a long way towards promoting local food production right here among our own student body! The Greenhouse also runs an annual City Farm School, which offers participants an intensive 8 month internship and workshops in Urban Farming in Montreal . Drop in anytime to learn, to relax, to get involved, or just to see how beautiful Montreal is from inside a greenhouse 13 stories off the ground . The City Farm School project is founded with the same principles and goals of the Concordia Greenhouse, to facilitate education through an experience-based model . The primary goal of this project is to respond to a growing interest in issues around food sovereignty, beekeeping, and the practice of urban agriculture as well as to provide an opportunity for students and community to collaborate . See our website for ways to get involved!
