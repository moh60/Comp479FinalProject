Climate Justice & Divestment
Climate justice is a term that evolved from the recognition that the effects of the climate crisis are multifaceted, and necessarily overlap with both social and economic justice. Climate justice movements seek to center voices of those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate crises and environmental destruction. The fossil fuel divestment movement defends climate justice through politically isolating climate change’s most nefarious contributors: the oil, gas, and coal industries.
 
Divestment campaign overview
Approx. $12 million of Concordia’s endowment fund is actively invested in the fossil fuel and related industries. The University’s commitment to a failing system misrepresents our community’s real intentions and values. Accordingly, Divest Concordia, in collaboration with the CSU and Sustainable Concordia, has been working since 2013 to get Concordia to divest from fossil fuels and embrace a more ethical orientation for our investment portfolio. The divestment campaign at Concordia has lead to the creation of a Joint Sustainable Investments Advisory Committee (JSIAC) as well as the creation of a sustainable investment fund with the transfer of $5 million from the University’s endowment fund. In Fall 2016, undergraduate students demonstrated their support for the campaign by voting overwhelmingly in favour of divestment during a referendum. The divestment campaign partakes in coordinating popular education and mobilization activities, organizing creative events and direct actions, as well as strategic lobbying and contributing to JSIAC. The struggle for full divestment continues; the investments we make today shape the world we will live in tomorrow.
