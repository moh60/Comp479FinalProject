<body>Travel and Expenses
University Policy for Travel and Other Allowable Expenses
Two copies of a “Grant Acceptance form” will be enclosed with a letter informing you that you have been awarded a PD grant. Please read this form carefully and keep a copy on-hand for future reference. Don’t forget to sign one copy and return it to CUPFA within 30 days of receiving your grant notification.
All of your expenses must be in accordance with University policy in order to be eligible for reimbursement. If this policy is not followed Financial Services will not reimburse you. Please read the Policy for Travel and other Allowable Expenses carefully   Policy for travel and other allowable expenses
Paying Professionals
NEVER pay someone directly; they must be paid through the University. If hiring an individual or an organization (e.g., technicians, musicians, studio rental), you must complete a cheque requisition form and the University will pay the individual/organization. If you make payment yourself you will not be reimbursed. Contact your budget officer to receive cheque requisition forms.
Paying Concordia Students
If you received a PD Grant and are hiring Concordia students you must fill out a RA contract and the student(s) must fill out a TRAC Union membership form. They will still be paid directly from the CUPFA PDA account. Contact your Budget Officer for more information.
Steps for paying a Concordia Student
Make sure you read the TRAC Contract Instructions carefully
1) The Concordia student must fill out a TRAC membership form
2) Fill out the contract, sign it and have the Concordia student/Research Assistant sign it
3) Return the form to your budget office along with a void cheque for Payroll (so the money can be deposited directly into the student’s account.)
4) Your budget officer inputs the CUPFA budget codes
5) The completed contract and void cheque will be forwarded to payroll
6) The TRAC membership form must be forwarded to TRAC
