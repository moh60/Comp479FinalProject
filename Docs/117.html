Aiming to Foster Community
The GSA values inclusion and diversity as it makes us stronger, more relevant, and more successful. As a membership association, the GSA represents and advocates on behalf of all Concordia graduates. We fully support equality in their gatherings; cordial and respectful communications; safe social interactions; and an environment that reflects fairness and mutual respect.
The GSA expects its members to adhere to principles of inclusivity and universally apply it to their communities, events, and interactions.
