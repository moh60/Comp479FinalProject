CSU Committee Funding
Committees of the CSU manage annual budgets for the activities of the CSU that can also be accessed for project funding within certain limits. Each committee has a specific mandate, and will only provide funding to initiatives within this mandate. Priority access to these funds is given to undergraduate Concordia students, however – in some cases – funding can be awarded to graduate students, Concordia community organizations, or external projects and organizations, especially if Concordia undergrads are involved. Each committee accepts applications on a rolling basis.
Black, Indigenous, People of Colour (BIPOC) Committee
The BIPOC committee is a closed committee made up of Black, Indigenous and People of Colour. It is responsible for approving funding applications for events, initiatives, and projects organized by and for Black, Indigenous and People of Colour. It was created as a result of lack of access to funding for BIPOC individuals, particularly within the CSU.
If you are a BIPOC person organizing an event or initiative that will directly benefit BIPOC community members – on campus and beyond – you can collaborate with the CSU BIOPOC committee. The funding is available for students as well as community members, and there is no limit to how much can be applied for.
