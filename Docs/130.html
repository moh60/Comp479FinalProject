Step 5 — System availability
On the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8:00 a.m. onward. The registration system may be extremely busy at 8:00 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date so it is strongly recommended that you wait until later in the day.
Step 6 — Registration
While departmental and faculty advisers and staff are always available to give advice and guidance, you are responsible for the completeness and correctness of your course selection and registration, and for observing the University’s regulations and deadlines.
While most programs offer online registration, there are some programs that require onsite registration within the department.  If you have not received information concerning the registration process for your program,  please contact your department for more information.
Program of Study Verification – before starting to register for courses, you should verify your current program of study by using the following navigation:
   NAVIGATION:  Academics > My Academics
If the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact your department to find out how to make corrections. It is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or option may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible.
Address Verification – On the Student Center page, you will see your current address. If you need to correct your address or any other piece of personal information, double click on the relevant area under the Personal Information banner and you will be redirected to another screen where you can make the necessary changes.
Please note that you are responsible for providing the University with your current mailing and e-mail address. You are required to fulfill all financial and administrative obligations within the prescribed deadlines regardless of the validity of your address in our files.
         A — Adding classes
You can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note:
If you have a financial hold you will not be able to register in classes until you clear the hold.
Classes can only be added until the add/drop deadline for a given term.
For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.
   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Add
Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.
If you are taking Qualifying courses which are at the undergraduate level, select the Undergraduate.
Graduate Degree, Qualifying, Independent and Visiting students are able to register for Graduate Professional Development courses in addition to the their program courses.
Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection.
Click the Continue button. 
 
Find a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the Enter Class Nbr field
Class Search – refer to Search for Classes section if you need help in this area.
To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course.
If satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose select class. 
Confirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further:
Once you have selected the tutorial, press Next. 
You will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart. 
At this point, you may continue to add further courses to your Course Cart.
Once you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the “Proceed To Step 2 of 3” OR ‘enroll’ button in order to go to the final confirmation page.
If your registration was successful you will see the following message:
If it was unsuccessful you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example:
For example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent.  In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to still have seats available. This is generally caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. 
Remember to register for both Fall (2172), Fall/Winter (2173) and Winter (2174) at the same time – do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity.
         B — Dropping classes
Please note: If you only want to change sections of the same course see Step 6, C – Swapping classes.
There are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines link under the Important Information section of the Student Center page.
Please note the following important details:
DNE – did not enter – The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. For Master and PhD students, tuition and other fees are billed on a per term basis regardless if registered in course credits.  If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees.
DISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. A withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course.  For Master and PhD students refer to the Academic dates for further information.
Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade.
If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite.
Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term.
If you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared.  For Master and PhD students, certain programs will drop your courses also.
For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.
   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop
Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.
Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table.
Click the Continue button. 
All registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections.
Select the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so.
Select the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC.
         C — Swapping classes (including Section changes)
You can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop.  The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available. 
DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course.
There are some restrictions attached to swapping classes:
If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold.
Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term. 
For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.
If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes.
To swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap ECON 521 for ECON 561 while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.
 
   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap
Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.
Click the Continue button. 
The first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled.
The next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it.
Select the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid.
Select the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid.
If you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page.
If you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page.
If you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page.
Confirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button.
If the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar:
View My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction:
Swapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components)
Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid.  You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled.
Confirm your selection.  All related components of a class will be displayed.
Verify the swap transaction.
View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration.
PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist.
For example:
You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X.
         D — Wait listing classes
Once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list.  Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not.  To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:
