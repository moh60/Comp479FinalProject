<body>Survival Guide
A new, updated version of the Survival Guide will be launched in Fall 2017. Stay tuned!
The Association is pleased to offer its members the CUPFA’S SURVIVAL GUIDE TO THE UNIVERSITY. To all new CUPFA members — a warm welcome! This guide was created to help all members find their way through some administrative traffic. As well, we hope it will facilitate your life here at Concordia. This GUIDE will be periodically updated. Consult, survive, and prosper.
