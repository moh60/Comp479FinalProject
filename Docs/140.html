<body>Intro to Sketchup
Sketchup is a popular 3D modeling software which has a wide range of uses in architectural design, interior design, civil and mechanical engineering. Compared to other 3D modeling software, Sketchup is easily to learn and supported by a friendly interface. Compelling walkthroughs, house staining and detailed models can be created in this software; Sketchup files can also be exported to other simulation software, such as Energy Plus, Wufi, Transys and others.  This workshop will get you started on the right foot with Sketchup! We will look at basic commands to model the interior and exterior of buildings, and model a quick example. Finally we will look at some useful Sketchup plugins, for example one plugin makes it simple to 3D print your creation.  Please bring a laptop with Sketchup installed on it.
