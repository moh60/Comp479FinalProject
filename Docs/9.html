Senate
As stated in the university by-laws, Senate is subservient to the Board of Governors from which it derives its authority.
The By-laws delineate the powers of the Board of Governors (highest governing body having overall superintending power) and those of Senate (highest academic body).
Senate is the highest academic decision-making body at Concordia . It has the final say over all curriculum changes, and control over all of the university’s Academic Policies . It is made up of 55 voting members, which includes the President (who also chairs Senate), two Vice-Presidents, the Deans, 28 faculty members, 12 undergraduate students (appointed by the CSU), and four graduate students . The remaining members of the Senior Administration also sit on Senate as non-voting members . Senate is an enormously important body at Concordia, since it has exclusive jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the University’s academic mission .
 
These institutions function based on the values of collegiality and participation . That is to say, they operate on the fundamental principles of including all important stakeholders (the different members of the Concordia community) in decisions and of respecting and duly considering each member’s participation and input . The full realization of these values help to make these institutions important vehicles for democratic decision-making, ensuring that their decisions are seen as legitimate by all of the groups involved in making Concordia great .
Senate is the final authority in all matters pertaining to the academic programs of the university, such as approval of the spring and fall graduation lists, approval of curricula, establishment of academic standards and regulations.
