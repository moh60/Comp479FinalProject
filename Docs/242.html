a)  The principal criteria for appointments are academic and professional excellence.
 
b)  Canadian applicants for a position as professional librarian shall be given first consideration and, in the case of candidates assessed as essentially equal, shall be given priority.
c)  The Parties agree that Concordia University would better advance the essential functions of the University, namely the pursuit, creation and dissemination of knowledge through teaching and research, if the diverse composition of Canadian society were better reflected in the bargaining unit. Therefore the Parties agree to encourage an increase in the proportion of members of under-represented designated groups as defined in the relevant legislation, to improve their employment status, and to ensure their full participation in the University community. The Parties therefore endorse the principle of equity in employment and agree to cooperate in the identification and removal of all barriers to the recruitment, selection, hiring, retention, and promotion of these designated groups, and other categories as may be designated in federal and provincial human rights legislation or agreed to by the Parties.
d)  To be appointed as a professional librarian an individual shall have an appropriate bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree from an ALA-accredited library and information science program, or approved equivalent training acceptable for membership in the Corporation of Professional Librarians of Québec.
e)  The Employer shall provide a process through which members may voluntarily identify themselves as belonging to one or more designated groups. Information pertaining to members submitted to government agencies under relevant legislation on employment equity shall be made available to JEEC and to the Association on an aggregate basis within thirty (30) days of submission.
f)  If the data on professional librarian availability indicates that a particular designated group is under represented, then, all things being equal, candidates from that designated group shall be given priority.

b)  This performance evaluation shall take place in the Fall of every even-numbered year. Criteria for awarding Career Development Increments (CDI)/step increases shall be governed by Article 14.01.  Continuing members shall submit dossiers as stipulated in paragraph c) below, and shall be evaluated on their performance of duties (Article 16).
 
c)  On or before October 1 in even-numbered years, continuing members shall submit to the academic unit head a complete updated curriculum vitae, and a dossier, prepared according to the provisions of Article 14.01 k), covering only their activities over the previous two (2) academic years. Members who are on leave on October 1 may choose not to submit their dossier. In such cases, the member shall submit their dossier for the same two-year period on or before October 1 of the following year.
d)  The academic unit head shall convene the DPC and shall provide it with the dossier submitted by each tenured member and ETA member holding a five-year contract as well as any relevant additional documentation already contained in the member’s personnel file. The candidate shall receive copies of all supplemental documentation and shall have five (5) days to provide any commentary relevant to this supplementary information. The DPC shall evaluate the dossiers for all such members. Based upon the evaluation, the DPC shall make recommendations regarding CDI/step increasesfor all members.
e)  The DPC shall prepare a reasoned report for each member who has submitted a dossier. In each of the categories evaluated, as well as overall, performance shall be judged to be satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  Overall satisfactory performance leads to the awarding of CDI/ step increases in accordance with Article 39.  The report and a copy of the dossier shall be sent to the Dean by December 1. A copy of the report shall be sent at the same time to the member.
f)  The FPTC shall review the member’s dossier and the DPC recommendation. When the FPTC agrees with a recommendation of the DPC, that recommendation becomes the decision.

In such a case, the Dean shall accept either the DPC or the FPTC recommendation and shall inform each member in writing by March 1 of the final decision in her or his case, with a copy to the academic unit head.
g)  Probationary members and members with three-year ETA appointments shall not be evaluated for the purpose of awarding CDI/step increases, but shall automatically be eligible for granted CDI/step increases in accordance with Article 39.
 
h) Members who were hired, granted tenure, reappointed in the case of a five-year ETA, or promoted in an even-numbered year shall not be evaluated, and will automatically be eligible to receive CDI/step increases in the two subsequent academic years. Such members will be evaluated in the subsequent performance review exercise occurring in an even-numbered year.

16.02  While the pattern of duties and responsibilities indicated in 16.01 varies among academic units and among individuals, these constitute the principal obligations of any faculty member holding a full‑time appointment.
16.03   In accordance with the established procedures of the academic unit, and by mutual agreement with the faculty member, the academic unit heads and the Dean(s), academic duties may be assigned and carried out in academic units other than the member’s primary unit. In the case of members holding a joint or cross appointment, or participating in an interdisciplinary teaching or research project with one or more members of another academic unit, academic duties in both primary and secondary units shall be considered part of the member’s duties for the purposes of all evaluations conducted under the provisions of Articles 14 and 18.
16.04   TEACHING LOAD AND TEACHING ASSIGNMENT
a)  The teaching load for each member shall be determined in a fair and equitable manner by the Dean, who shall take into consideration the dossier submitted for the biennial performance evaluation, if applicable.
b)  In years in which no performance review takes place, the Dean may request from some or all members of the Faculty a summary of teaching, research and service activities since the most recent performance review. Having assessed this material, the Dean may alter the teaching load in conformity with the provisions of Article 16.
c)  A Faculty or academic unit may develop guidelines on course remissions to be used in the determination of teaching load.

Courses added to the teaching assignment shall include only those that the member has taught in one or more of the previous three (3) academic years.
j)  When the teaching program of an academic unit or a Faculty includes courses in each of the three (3) terms of the academic year, the faculty member’s teaching assignment is spread out over the fall and winter terms, unless there is a written agreement with the faculty member to the contrary. In the case of those academic units that offer programs in the Institute for Cooperative Education, a faculty member’s teaching assignment may be spread over any two (2) of three (3) terms, if the faculty member is participating in the programs, unless there is written agreement with the faculty member to the contrary.
k)  Notwithstanding the above, and in the case of other special or extensive summer programs, a faculty member may, by mutual agreement, spread the teaching assignment over two (2) or three (3) terms, but no faculty member shall be required to teach during all three (3) terms except as specified in Article 16.12.

i)  increase the member’s teaching load if justified under the provisions of Article 16.08 a), b) and c), taking into account the extent of the member’s service;
 
ii)  reduce the member’s teaching load if justified under the provisions of Article 16.08 a), b) and c) in cases where the member combines the teaching assignment with assigned extensive administrative responsibilities (e.g., undergraduate or graduate program Director), or with heavy responsibilities to manage and administer her or his research project(s).
 
e)  No tenured member shall be assigned more than twelve (12) courses over a two (2) year period, except as specified in Article 16.12 a) or, by mutual agreement, as per Article 16.04 i), provided the overload is offset by an equivalent reduction in the academic year immediately preceding or following the two year period.
