Best Practices for Multi-Section Courses
The following link is to a document that was created by a committee comprised of a part-time faculty member; Associate Deans from A&S, ENCS, and the JMSB; and a Vice Provost.  It is intended to guide in the creation, teaching and evaluation of students in multi-sections courses ie. any course that has two or more sections in any given semester.  Part-time faculty are recommended to consult this guideline for its many useful “best practices”.
